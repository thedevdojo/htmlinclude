# HTML Include

A simple script to add HTML includes inside of your HTML ðŸ”®

Simple example:

```
<include src="./nav.html"></include>
```

You'll also need to include the script and you'll also need to have a file in the same directory named `nav.html`, and it will include that HTML file inside of your page ðŸ˜‰
